# 리액트 시작

## 리액트 컴포넌트를 만드는 방법
개발사 메타에 따르면 리액트는 UI를 위한 자바스크립트 라이브러리다.\
독립적이고 재사용가능한 '컴포넌트'를 기반으로 작동.\
리액트는 루트 컴포넌트에서 하위 컴포넌트로 흐름이 있다.

리액트는 UI를 부분만 업데이트해서 렌더링의 효율을 높인다.\
이때 VDOM을 사용.\
업데이트 후 업데이트 전의 VDOM과의 스냅샷과 비교해서 변경된 부분만 업데이트.

## 프롭과 상태
프롭(Prop)과 상태(State)는 컴포넌트를 렌더링하기 위한 입력 데이터다. 컴포넌트는 프롭이나 상태가 바뀌면 다시 렌더링한다.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
